## 1. Project Overview

**EconoSim** is a multi-agent AI economic simulation platform where households, firms, banks, and government interact in a closed economy. Macroeconomic behavior emerges from micro-level incentives, accounting rules, market interactions, policy, and shocks.

**Goals**: Research-capable simulation platform, portfolio project, future paper/demo candidate, possible startup-grade sandbox for economic experimentation.

**Core principles** (in priority order):
1. Accounting integrity (stock-flow consistency)
2. Coherent simulation dynamics
3. Reproducibility
4. Modularity
5. Experimentability
6. Future RL compatibility

**Key architectural decisions**:
- All monetary flows go through the central `Ledger` via double-entry transactions
- `transfer_deposits()` uses two within-entity double-entry postings (sender: debit equity/credit deposits; receiver: debit deposits/credit equity) to preserve A-L=E on every transfer
- Loan issuance creates money (endogenous money), repayment destroys it
- Write-offs transfer losses to bank equity and relieve borrower debt
- Agent decision logic is rule-based (simple, interpretable, debuggable)
- Domain logic is fully decoupled from any framework (no Mesa dependency)

## 7. Major Design Decisions and Rationale

1. **Double-entry accounting via central Ledger**: Every monetary flow is recorded as a transaction. No silent creation/destruction of money except via explicit loan issuance (endogenous money creation) and write-offs.

2. **Within-entity double-entry for transfers**: `transfer_deposits()` posts two within-entity transactions rather than one cross-entity transaction. This ensures A-L=E is preserved on every entity after every transfer, regardless of whether the entity is a bank (deposits=LIABILITY) or non-bank (deposits=ASSET).

3. **No Mesa dependency**: Domain logic is pure Python. The simulation loop is a simple function that calls sub-steps in order. This keeps the system testable, debuggable, and framework-independent.

4. **Pydantic for config**: Typed, validated configuration with sensible defaults. YAML scenario files for experiment definition.

5. **Rule-based agents first**: Simple, interpretable decision rules (consumption propensity, inventory-target pricing, capital adequacy lending) that can be debugged and compared against future RL policies.

6. **Bank equity = initial reserves**: At inception, the bank's only asset is reserves. Equity must equal net assets (reserves - 0 liabilities = reserves). The `initial_equity` config param was misleading and was fixed.

7. **Sovereign money creation (MMT/SFC approach)**: The government is a currency issuer. When fiscal spending would exceed deposits, it creates money via `ensure_solvency()` (debit deposits/credit equity). This prevents government deposit depletion from killing the economy. Tracked via `money_created` and `cumulative_money_created`.

8. **Buffer-stock consumption (SFC standard)**: Household consumption = α1 × disposable_income + α2 × wealth. The wealth term (α2=0.4) ensures spending continues when income drops, preventing deflationary death spirals.

9. **Revenue-based hiring**: Firms estimate demand using `max(prev_units_sold, prev_revenue / price)`. This ensures government service contracts (which provide revenue but not goods sales) still signal hiring demand.

10. **Government spending as fiscal stabilizer**: Government spending is injected as service contracts even when firms have zero inventory. This prevents a doom loop where zero inventory → zero spending → zero revenue → zero hiring.

---

## 8. Known Bugs / Limitations / Technical Debt

- ~~**Firm `inventory_asset` account** exists on balance sheet but is never updated~~ → **FIXED** (Session 6): `_sync_inventory_asset()` now updates after production and sales
- **Mild deflation**: With current defaults, prices decline slowly over long runs. This is a calibration issue — the goods market is supply-constrained and household savings accumulate. Acceptable for MVP.
- **No household borrowing**: Credit market only serves firms currently.
- ~~**Single good, single labor type**: MVP constraint, by design~~ → **ADDRESSED** (Phase 4): `multi_sector.py` and `skilled_labor.py` extensions built, pending integration into core sim loop
- **No firm entry/exit**: Fixed number of firms throughout simulation.
- **Bank reserves**: Not actively managed or constrained. Reserves account exists but isn't depleted by lending (endogenous money creation doesn't require reserves in current model).
- **Phase 4 extensions not yet integrated**: Multi-sector, skills, bonds, expectations, and networks modules are built and tested but not yet wired into the core simulation step loop. They function as standalone modules ready for integration.

---

## 9. Open Questions

- ~~Should firm inventory be tracked on the balance sheet as an asset?~~ → **Resolved**: Yes, `_sync_inventory_asset()` now tracks it.
- What is the right calibration for agent parameters to produce plausible 120-period dynamics?
- How to handle firm bankruptcy / exit in later phases?
- How to best integrate Phase 4 extensions into the core sim loop without breaking backward compatibility?
  - Option A: Feature flags in SimulationConfig (e.g., `enable_multi_sector: bool = False`)
  - Option B: Separate extended simulation builder (e.g., `build_extended_simulation()`)
  - Option C: Plugin/hook system where extensions register themselves
- Should bond market replace or supplement sovereign money creation?
- How to calibrate skill distributions and training rates for realistic dynamics?

---

## 10. Experiment Notes

### Baseline (20 periods, default params)
- Full employment (U=0%) sustained through period 19
- GDP ~7,000-8,000 (nominal)
- Mild deflation (~3% per period) — prices drift from 10.0 → 7.1
- Government money creation kicks in around period 34 when initial deposits deplete
- Accounting invariants hold throughout

## 12. Changelog

### Session 1 — 2025-03-15
- Created project structure and packaging
- Implemented core accounting layer (Account, BalanceSheet, Ledger, Transaction)
- Implemented loan contracts (LoanContract, LoanBook)
- Implemented inventory tracking (Inventory)
- Implemented all 4 agent types (Household, Firm, Bank, Government)
- Implemented all 3 market modules (Labor, Goods, Credit)
- Implemented simulation engine with 10-step loop
- Implemented shock system (supply, demand, credit, fiscal)
- Implemented metrics engine (GDP, unemployment, inflation, Gini, credit)
- Implemented config system with Pydantic schemas
- Implemented experiment runner with batch support
- Created RL interface scaffold
- Created baseline and supply_shock scenario YAML files
- **Bug fix**: Bank initial equity was set to `equity + reserves` but only reserves existed as an asset. Fixed to `equity = reserves`.
- **Bug fix**: `transfer_deposits()` only moved deposit assets without adjusting equity, breaking A-L=E invariant. Rewrote as two within-entity double-entry postings that adjust both deposits and equity on each side.
- **Bug fix**: Bank interest payment handler double-counted equity adjustment. Removed redundant manual post after `transfer_deposits` was fixed.
- Fixed Pydantic v2 deprecation warning (class Config → model_config dict)
- Wrote 55 tests covering accounting, contracts, goods, simulation integration
- All tests passing, all accounting invariants verified

### Session 2 — 2025-03-15 (dynamics fixes)
- **Bug fix**: Economy collapsed to GDP=0 and 100% unemployment by period 21. Root causes:
  - Government spending was gated on firm inventory → no money injection when inventory=0
  - Price adjustment raised prices infinitely when sales=0 (dead market ≠ excess demand)
  - Firm hiring based only on `prev_units_sold`, missing government service contract revenue
  - Initial demand estimate (`prev_units_sold`) overwritten by `reset_period_state()` at t=0
  - Government ran out of finite deposits → economy lost its fiscal stabilizer
- **Fix**: Sovereign money creation via `Government.ensure_solvency()` (MMT/SFC currency issuer)
- **Fix**: Government spending now injects as service contracts even with zero inventory
- **Fix**: Price adjustment only raises prices when there were actual sales (`prev_units_sold > 0.1`)
- **Fix**: Revenue-based hiring: `demand_estimate = max(prev_units_sold, prev_revenue / price)`
- **Fix**: Minimum hiring floor (always try 1 worker if affordable)
- **Fix**: Initial demand estimate now sets `units_sold` and `revenue` (not `prev_units_sold`) so `reset_period_state()` propagates correctly
- **Fix**: Buffer-stock consumption rule: C = α1 × income + α2 × wealth (SFC standard)
- Recalibrated defaults: wage=60, productivity=8, wealth_propensity=0.4, firm_deposits=15000
- Added CLI entry point (`python -m econosim`)
- Created README.md
- All 55 tests still passing

### Session 3 — 2025-03-15 (Phase 2: experiments + dashboard)
- Enhanced `run_batch()` to return aggregated DataFrame with 95% CI bands via `aggregate_runs()`
- Added `run_parameter_sweep()` for systematic parameter exploration (dotted paths, cartesian product)
- Added `enrich_dataframe()` (inflation, GDP growth, velocity), `compare_scenarios()` (long-form comparison)
- Fixed `model_copy` bug: parameter sweep used `deep=True` + `setattr` instead of `update=` which replaced sub-models with dicts
- Built Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) with:
  - Full sidebar config for all agent/market parameters
  - KPI cards (GDP, unemployment, price, Gini, loans)
  - Tabbed layout: Macro, Labor & Firms, Money & Credit, Data

### Session 6 — 2026-03-15 (Phase 5: Modern UI + Bug Fixes)

**Next.js Dashboard (`web/`)**:
- Created Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 frontend
- Dark theme with gradient accents, smooth animations (fadeIn, pulse-glow, shimmer)

  - `_sync_inventory_asset()` method adjusts balance after production and sales
  - Called after `produce()`, goods market clearing, and government purchases
  - Firm equity now correctly includes inventory value

- Balance sheet invariant now holds including inventory asset tracking

**Test Coverage Expansion** (130 → 208 tests):
- Added `tests/test_agents/test_household.py` — 14 tests (init, decisions, period state, observations)
- Added `tests/test_agents/test_firm.py` — 20 tests (init, decisions, production, inventory sync, borrowing)
- Added `tests/test_agents/test_government.py` — 12 tests (init, tax, transfers, sovereign money, budget)

### Session 7 — Radical UI Overhaul & Deployment Fix

**Vercel Deployment Fix**:
- Created `api/requirements.txt` — Vercel's `@vercel/python` builder looks for requirements relative to the handler file, not the project root
- Updated `vercel.json` with `maxLambdaSize: "50mb"` to accommodate numpy/pandas
- The `sys.path.insert` approach in `api/main.py` works because Vercel deploys all project files

**Radical UI Redesign** (all files in `web/src/`):

*Global Styles (`app/globals.css`)*:
- New color palette: deeper background (`#06080d`), richer surface colors, three accent colors (blue, violet, cyan)
- Subtle grid background pattern with radial gradient
- Glass morphism utilities (`.glass`, `.glass-strong`) with backdrop blur
- Blue glow effects (`.glow-blue`, `.glow-blue-sm`)
- New animations: `fadeInScale`, `slideInRight`, `float`, `gradient-shift`, `count-up`
- Staggered animation delays for child elements (`.stagger-children`)
- Custom range input styling with glowing thumb
- Chart container with gradient border effect (`.chart-container`)

  - `enable_expectations`: Creates `AgentExpectations` per firm
  - `enable_networks`: Creates `TradeNetwork` and `CreditNetwork`
  - `enable_bonds`: Creates `BondMarket` and `GovernmentDebtManager`
- `step()` integration points:
  - Network edge decay at start of each period
  - Credit network records new loans after credit market clearing
  - Trade network records firm sales after goods market clearing
  - Bond issuance when government faces fiscal shortfall (before sovereign money creation)
  - Bond debt service (coupons + maturities) after loan debt service

### Session 11 — 2026-03-16 (Comprehensive Simulation Stress Testing)

**Goal**: Run exhaustive stress tests across all edge cases, parameter extremes, extension combinations, shock responses, and economic policy scenarios to validate the core simulation engine's soundness.

**New test file**: `tests/test_stress.py` (109 tests across 13 categories)

*Test Categories*:
1. **Baseline Sanity** (7 tests): 120-period run, positive GDP, employment, nonzero prices/wages, reproducibility (same seed = same results), different seeds differ
2. **Accounting Invariants** (6 tests): Balance sheets balanced across 5 seeds (1, 17, 42, 99, 12345), no negative deposits, bank capital ratio consistency, deposit tracking, government budget identity (tax - transfers - spending = balance), employment ≤ labor force
3. **Extension Combinations** (10 tests): All 8 combinations of {expectations, networks, bonds} on/off, 200-period long run with all extensions, extensions-off equals baseline
4. **Extreme Parameters** (22 tests): Single firm, 50 firms, single household, 500 households, zero/high initial deposits (HH and firm), min/max consumption propensity, zero wealth propensity, very high/low productivity, very high/low prices, very high/low wages, fast price/wage adjustment, 5-period and 500-period runs, very high/zero reservation wage
5. **Banking Edge Cases** (5 tests): Very high/low capital adequacy ratio, very high/zero interest rates, loan defaults don't break accounting
6. **Government Policy** (8 tests): Zero/high spending, zero/high tax rate, fiscal multiplier (higher spending → higher GDP), tax drag (higher taxes → lower consumption), sovereign money creation with zero initial deposits, generous transfers reduce inequality
7. **Economic Dynamics** (4 tests): Higher productivity → higher GDP, higher consumption propensity → higher GDP, more households → higher GDP, higher demand → higher consumption, credit system functional
8. **Shock Responses** (8 tests): Supply shock, demand shock reduces GDP, credit crunch, fiscal austerity reduces GDP, stimulus raises GDP, multiple simultaneous shocks, shocks with all extensions enabled
9. **Scenario Presets** (4 tests): Baseline, high growth (higher GDP than baseline), recession (lower GDP), tight money
10. **Batch Run Stability** (3 tests): 5-seed batch, 10-seed batch, batch with all extensions
11. **Metric Consistency** (8 tests): All metrics bounded (5 seeds), GDP nonnegative, Gini in [0,1], unemployment in [0,1], employment identity, wage income positive when employed
12. **Combined Stress** (8 tests): Recession + all extensions, credit crunch + extensions, stagflation (supply shock + loose fiscal), everything-extreme (all params extreme + all shocks + all extensions), deflationary death spiral handled, hyperinflation stable, 10-seed robustness sweep
13. **API Simulation** (3 tests): run_experiment default, run_experiment with extensions, run_batch

**Key Findings**:
- **Accounting invariants are rock solid**: Balance sheets stay balanced across all scenarios — extreme parameters, shocks, extensions, combined stress
- **No NaN or Inf values** in any metric under any tested scenario
- **No negative deposits** anywhere — money conservation holds
- **No crashes** — even with deflationary spirals, hyperinflation conditions, simultaneous shocks, extreme parameters
- **Economic logic verified**: fiscal multiplier works, tax drag confirmed, productivity → GDP, demand → consumption, transfers reduce inequality
- **Extensions integrate cleanly**: All 8 flag combinations work, 200-period long runs stable, extensions don't affect baseline when disabled
- **All 4 dashboard presets** produce expected relative economic behavior

**Model Observations** (not bugs — valid model characteristics):
- Firms don't borrow much under default config — government spending provides sufficient demand without credit expansion
- With very low demand, inventory goes to zero because firms rationally stop producing
- Prices can fall even with money creation if supply-side productivity constraints dominate (low productivity → ample inventory → price adjustment lowers prices)
- Gini coefficient is relatively insensitive to transfer amount when employment is high (transfers only go to unemployed)

**Tests**: 385 → 494 passing, 0 warnings

**New files**: `tests/test_stress.py` (1,087 lines, 109 tests)
